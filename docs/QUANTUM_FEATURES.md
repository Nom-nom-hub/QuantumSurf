# Quantum Features

This document explains the quantum computing features implemented in QuantumSurf.

## Overview

QuantumSurf leverages quantum computing to enhance browsing capabilities. The application can use either real quantum hardware (via IBM Quantum) or simulated quantum computing when hardware is unavailable.

## Implemented Quantum Algorithms

### Grover's Search Algorithm

Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. In QuantumSurf, it's used to:

- Enhance search functionality
- Optimize content indexing
- Improve pattern matching in large datasets

Implementation details:
- Located in `src/quantum/quantum_scripts/grover_search.py`
- JavaScript interface in `src/quantum/realQuantumLayer.js`
- Fallback simulation in `src/quantum/simulatedQuantumLayer.js`

### Quantum Key Generation

Quantum key generation uses quantum properties to create truly random encryption keys:

- Enhanced security for sensitive operations
- True randomness based on quantum mechanics
- Resistant to algorithmic prediction

Implementation details:
- Located in `src/quantum/quantum_scripts/key_generation.py`
- JavaScript interface in `src/quantum/realQuantumLayer.js`

### QAOA Optimization

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is used for:

- Resource allocation optimization
- Network routing improvements
- Browser cache optimization

Implementation details:
- Located in `src/quantum/quantum_scripts/qaoa_optimization.py`
- JavaScript interface in `src/quantum/realQuantumLayer.js`

## Architecture

QuantumSurf uses a layered approach to quantum computing:

1. **JavaScript Frontend** (`src/quantum/*.js`)
   - Provides high-level interfaces for the application
   - Handles fallback to simulation when needed

2. **Python Bridge** (`src/quantum/quantum_bridge.js`)
   - Connects JavaScript to Python quantum code
   - Manages communication between layers

3. **Quantum Scripts** (`src/quantum/quantum_scripts/*.py`)
   - Implements quantum algorithms using Qiskit
   - Connects to IBM Quantum hardware when available

## Configuration

Quantum features can be configured in `src/config/quantumConfig.js`:

- Provider selection (IBM, AWS, Azure)
- Execution preferences
- Simulation settings

Example configuration:
```javascript
{
  providers: {
    ibm: {
      enabled: true,
      apiKey: process.env.IBM_QUANTUM_API_KEY
    }
  },
  execution: {
    preferredProvider: 'ibm',
    fallbackToSimulation: true
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Quantum computations can be time-consuming, especially on real hardware
- Queue times for real quantum hardware can vary significantly
- Simulation is faster but lacks true quantum advantages
- Consider using the fallback simulation for development and testing
